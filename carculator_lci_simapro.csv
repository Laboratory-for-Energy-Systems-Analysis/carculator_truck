Comment
Originally published in: Cozzolini, F. Life Cycle Assessment of Biofuels in EU/CH, 2018.. Description: Production of ethanol from maize starch. The burden associated with the supply of maize starch (e.g., direct and indirect land use change, fertlizers, electricity, etc.) is fully accounted for, as it is not a residual material. The transport and conditioning of the biomass residues is also accounted for.. Special remark: This dataset has not been peer reviewed. Therefore, results using this datasets should be considered with caution..

Comment
Originally published in: F. Cozzolini. Internal study for PSI.. Description: Production of ethanol from forest residues. There is no burden associated with the supply of biomass residues. That includes no burden associated to the production of crops and no burden associated to direct and indirect land use change. The transport and comnditioning of the biomass residues is howver accounted for.. Special remark: This dataset has not been peer reviewed. Therefore, results using this datasets should be considered with caution..

Comment
Originally published in: Cozzolini, F. Life Cycle Assessment of Biofuels in EU/CH, 2018.. Description: Production of ethanol from forest residues. There is no burden associated with the supply of biomass residues. That includes no burden associated to the production of crops and no burden associated to direct and indirect land use change. The transport and comnditioning of the biomass residues is howver accounted for.. Special remark: This dataset has not been peer reviewed. Therefore, results using this datasets should be considered with caution..

Originally published in: Cozzolini, F. Life Cycle Assessment of Biofuels in EU/CH, 2018.. Description: Production of ethanol from forest residues. There is no burden associated with the supply of biomass residues. That includes no burden associated to the production of crops and no burden associated to direct and indirect land use change. The transport and comnditioning of the biomass residues is howver accounted for.. Special remark: This dataset has not been peer reviewed. Therefore, results using this datasets should be considered with caution..

Comment
Originally published in: Van Der Giesen, C., Kleijn, R., Kramer, G. J. Energy and Climate Impacts of Producing Synthetic Hydrocarbon Fuels from CO2. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2014, 48 (12), 7111�7121. https://doi.org/10.1021/es500191g.. Description: The reactor vessel consists of 4760 kg of steel (assuming 50 pct low alloyed steel and 50 pct chromium steel) and is filled with a mixture of 440 kg of RWGS catalyst and 1780 kg of sorbent, which need to be renewed every 4 years. Over a reactor lifetime of 30 years therefore 30/4 x 440 kg = 3300 kg of catalyst and 30/4 x 1780 kg = 13350 kg of sorbent is needed. Since two identical reactors are use in parallel all numbers are doubled in the unit process representing the construction of the fixed bed reactor..

Originally published in: F. Cozzolini. Internal study for PSI.. Description: Production of ethanol from forest residues. There is no burden associated with the supply of biomass residues. That includes no burden associated to the production of crops and no burden associated to direct and indirect land use change. The transport and comnditioning of the biomass residues is howver accounted for.. Special remark: This dataset has not been peer reviewed. Therefore, results using this datasets should be considered with caution..

Comment
Originally published in: Terlouw et al. 2021 (in review). Description: Carbon dioxide captured by direct air capture (DAC). The DAC unit is located less than a kilometer away from the synthetic fuel plant. The CO2 is pressurized at 25 bar.. Special remark: The process uses waste heat as a source of heat. The switch to a dedicated source of heat (e.g., natural gas-based) could significnatly change the results..

Comment
Originally published in: Surovtseva, D, Crossin, E, Pell, R, Stamford, L. Toward a life cycle inventory for graphite production. J Ind Ecol. 2022. Description: 26: 964– 979. https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.13234. Coal is a common precursor for the tar pitch which is used for the preparation of graphitization precursor and also for coating of the final spherical graphite. Relevant data include coal mining, coking to produce tar and distillation of tar to produce pitch. It is understood that the distillation of tar to pitch is generally integrated with the coal coking, and the authors were not able to identify a reputable source containing dedicated dataset for distillation. Allocation is based on physical yield of tar pitch..

Comment
Originally published in: Surovtseva, D, Crossin, E, Pell, R, Stamford, L. Toward a life cycle inventory for graphite production. J Ind Ecol. 2022. Description: 26: 964– 979. https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.13234. Coal is a common precursor for the tar pitch which is used for the preparation of graphitization precursor and also for coating of the final spherical graphite. Relevant data include coal mining, coking to produce tar and distillation of tar to produce pitch. It is understood that the distillation of tar to pitch is generally integrated with the coal coking, and the authors were not able to identify a reputable source containing dedicated dataset for distillation. Allocation is based on physical yield of tar pitch..

Originally published in: Surovtseva, D, Crossin, E, Pell, R, Stamford, L. Toward a life cycle inventory for graphite production. J Ind Ecol. 2022. Description: 26: 964– 979. https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.13234. Coal is a common precursor for the tar pitch which is used for the preparation of graphitization precursor and also for coating of the final spherical graphite. Relevant data include coal mining, coking to produce tar and distillation of tar to produce pitch. It is understood that the distillation of tar to pitch is generally integrated with the coal coking, and the authors were not able to identify a reputable source containing dedicated dataset for distillation. Allocation is based on physical yield of tar pitch..

"Originally published in: Originally from Dai, Q., Kelly, J. C., Gaines, L., & Wang, M. (2019). Life cycle analysis of lithium-ion batteries for automotive applications. Batteries, 5(2), 48.. Description: The inventory is modelled according to the publication of Dai et al. (2019), in which a battery pack with gross pack energy of 23.5 kWh made of 140 3.6 V- 46Ah prismatic cells is presented. Cells are made of nicke-manganese-cobalt (NCA) cathode and a graphite-based anode, liquid electrolyte and a porous plastic separator. Infrastructure is included as well in this dataset as """"electronic component factory"""". Adapted by: Eleonora Crenna, EMPA, Switzerland.. "

Originally published in: Surovtseva, D, Crossin, E, Pell, R, Stamford, L. Toward a life cycle inventory for graphite production. J Ind Ecol. 2022. Description: 26: 964– 979. https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.13234. Coal is a common precursor for the tar pitch which is used for the preparation of graphitization precursor and also for coating of the final spherical graphite. Relevant data include coal mining, coking to produce tar and distillation of tar to produce pitch. It is understood that the distillation of tar to pitch is generally integrated with the coal coking, and the authors were not able to identify a reputable source containing dedicated dataset for distillation. Allocation is based on physical yield of tar pitch..

Comment
Originally published in: Surovtseva, D, Crossin, E, Pell, R, Stamford, L. Toward a life cycle inventory for graphite production. J Ind Ecol. 2022. Description: 26: 964– 979. https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.13234. Coal is a common precursor for the tar pitch which is used for the preparation of graphitization precursor and also for coating of the final spherical graphite. Relevant data include coal mining, coking to produce tar and distillation of tar to produce pitch. It is understood that the distillation of tar to pitch is generally integrated with the coal coking, and the authors were not able to identify a reputable source containing dedicated dataset for distillation. Allocation is based on physical yield of tar pitch..

Description
Prospective life cycle assessment model for vehicles developed by the Paul Scherrer Institute.

Cut-off rules
All environmentally-relevant flows are included, as far as the authors knowledge permits.Also, residual material (e.g., biomass residue) and energy (e.g., waste heat) come free of burden, except for the necessary steps to make it reusable (transport, conditioning, etc.).

Energy model
The energy consumption of vehicles calculated based on a physics model, including inertia, rolling resistance, aerodynamic drag, road gradient, etc.

Transport model
Based on Sacchi et al. 2022

Allocation rules
The system modeling is attributional. In the instance of joint-production, the allocation of burden between co-products is generally based on the relative economic revenue of each product, to align with the underlying database ecoinvent cut-off.
